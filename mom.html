            <p>Amongst the many favorite things mom has cooked for us over the years, as hard as it is to choose just one dish, mom's <span>Agnolotti salad</span> with tomato and mozerella is the most memorable to me. I would choose it as my birthday meal almost every year, and mom being the amazing mother she is would spend the day making it. The sausage stuffing in the Agnolotti was the best and mom made the dough from scratch! That meal in particular brings back lots of great memories and reminds me of home.</p>

                <p>I've come a long way in my taste bud expansiveness and it's hard to believe I used to not eat pasta if there was anything green touching the plate. (God bless your soul) I remember this one meal you used to make for me that was so simple. I think it was <span>chicken, green beans and potatoes</span> cooked in water. (In water! What was I thinking!) You're culinary touch is so magical that you could make even the most bland combination of food taste like you're eating a michinline star restaurant. Looking back though, something tells me it wasn't so much about the flavor of the food but more so about the love that went into it. Wanting me to be fed and nourished despite my agonizing limiting taste buds, and the frustration that may have caused you. But of course you met my princess attitude with patience and kindness, with confidence that there was definitely something I could like. That even if it was something so simple (and dull) homecoming is not about extravagance, it's about knowing you are cared for and that someone is willing to labor over you so you can have that perfect bite. This idea is definitely something you have passed onto me as cooking for others is something I lose myself in. I cherish all the times that we get to cook together, and it's never about the detail of the recipe it's about being with you and cooking our love into the food.</p>

                <p>I first went to <span>Thanksgiving dinner</span> at the Russo house in Short Hills fifteen or sixteen years ago. I grew up enjoying the Thanksgiving meal, and of spending time with my family, but never before had I enjoyed such incredible food! Fifteen plus Thanksgivings, three new siblings, two new parents, two kids, and one dog later, I can truly call Thanksgiving my favorite holiday . . . and in that time it has become not just about the food, but about spending time with my extended family.</p>

                <p>When I was about 11 I went away to sleep away camp for the first time. I got very home sick. On the night we all got back I remember mom made a dish that was basically <span>rice, cheese, and tomatoes</span> all mixed together. I was pretty simple but I just remember it as one of the most satisfying meals of my childhood. It tasted like finally coming back home. </p>
